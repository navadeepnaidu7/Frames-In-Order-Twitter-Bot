## Overview
This Python script enables you to automatically tweet frames from a specific video on Twitter. The script utilizes the Tweepy library for Twitter authentication and posting, as well as the pyDrive library for interacting with Google Drive. The automation process is orchestrated using GitHub Actions.

## Prerequisites
Before using this script, make sure you have the following:

- Twitter API credentials (Bearer Token, Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token, Access Token Secret)
- Google Drive API credentials (Client ID, Client Secret, Refresh Token)
- Video frames stored in a Google Drive folder

## Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries by running `pip install tweepy pydrive`.
3. Set up environment variables for Twitter and Google Drive credentials.
4. Ensure your Google Drive folder ID is correctly configured in the script.

## Usage
Run the script to automatically tweet the next frame from the video. The script keeps track of the last tweeted frame index to avoid duplication.

python tweet.py

## GitHub Actions
The provided GitHub Actions workflow ensures periodic execution of the script. Adjust the workflow schedule according to your preferences in the `.github/workflows/tweet.yml` file.

## Important Files
- `tweet_frames.py`: The main Python script for tweeting video frames.
- `last_tweeted_photo_index.txt`: File storing the index of the last tweeted photo.
- `.github/workflows/tweet.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow for automation.

## Notes
- Make sure to handle API credentials securely, preferably using GitHub Secrets for actions.
- Customize the caption and any other details in the script according to your preferences.
